## Models

Default: `composer-2.5` (standard, not Fast) on Cursor; `dynamic free primary (inherit global model)` on OpenCode.

For hard/long-horizon tasks where Composer 2.5 is stuck, escalate to `grok-4.6` standard on Cursor. On OpenCode, always use a free model and validate with `bash scripts/update-free-models.sh --refresh && bash scripts/update-free-models.sh --probe`.

Avoid Fast variants and Other Models (Claude/GPT/Gemini) as Cursor defaults — they burn the separate $20+ Other Models pool 3–6× faster.
